# Title

## About
This repository is for my course assignment on learning how to use GitHub branches, issues, commits, and pull requests. The project demonstrates basic version control skills by creating branches, writing meaningful commits, using the issues system, and maintaining a structured repo.

## Body 1
Text here

## Plan
The current plan is to:
- Create a development branch and make multiple meaningful commits
- Link commits to issues and close them appropriately
- Create pull requests and merge changes into the main branch
- Maintain a clear and complete README file
- Organize the repository in a way that shows good version-control practices

## How the Repo Is Organized
- `main` branch: Contains the final, stable version of the project.
- `dev` branch: Used for development and testing changes before merging into main.
- `README.md`: Explains the purpose, plan, and structure of the project.
- Additional files: Created throughout development to demonstrate commits, issues, and pull requests.
