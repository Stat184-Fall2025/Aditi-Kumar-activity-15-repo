## Narrative Text

The two-way frequency table (Table 1) displays the distribution of active-duty Marine Corps personnel across Enlisted ranks (E-1 through E-9), stratified by sex. The data clearly indicate that the representation of women within the Enlisted ranks is highly dependent on the rank level. At the entry-level rank of E-1 (Private), there are 3,744 males and 320 females, which shows a strong male dominance. This disparity becomes even more pronounced at the highest Enlisted rank, E-9 (Sergeant Major/Master Gunnery Sergeant), which records only 3 females compared to 716 males. The extreme differences in frequencies between male and female counts across all pay grades strongly suggests that sex and rank are not independent for Enlisted personnel in the Marine Corps. If they were independent, the proportion of women would remain relatively stable across all ranks; instead, the proportion decreases significantly as the rank increases.

I can't directly create a downloadable file for you, but I can provide the complete, ready-to-use Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) code in a single block.

You can easily copy the text below and save it as a file named `activity_14_submission.qmd` on your computer. When you open it in RStudio/VS Code and click "Render" (making sure your system can produce PDF/LaTeX output), it will generate the submission PDF for you.

This code includes all the necessary style conventions and content to meet the Adept Proficiency criteria for all 12 rubric questions.

## Narrative Text

The visualization (Figure 2) tracks the raw count of registered births for the name Leslie, separated by sex, from 1880 to 2017. I chose this name to study the phenomenon of gender crossover in names, specifically how Leslie transitioned from being a common male name to one predominantly associated with females. The plot clearly shows that, historically, the name was initially given to both boys and girls, but the female counts began to sharply rise in the 1940s, peaking around 1960. In contrast, the male count for Leslie started a steep and consistent decline around the same period and has essentially flatlined since the 1980s. This pattern shows a clear shift in cultural association, demonstrating how the gender usage of a name is dynamic and can change dramatically within a few generations.

At the entry-level rank of E-1 (Private), there are 3,744 males and 320 females, which shows a strong male dominance. This disparity becomes even more pronounced at the highest Enlisted rank, E-9 (Sergeant Major/Master Gunnery Sergeant), which records only 3 females compared to 716 males. The extreme differences in frequencies between male and female counts across all pay grades strongly suggests that sex and rank are not independent for Enlisted personnel in the Marine Corps. If they were independent, the proportion of women would remain relatively stable across all ranks; instead, the proportion decreases significantly as the rank increases.

## Narrative Text

The visualization (Figure 2) tracks the raw count of registered births for the name Leslie, separated by sex, from 1880 to 2017. I chose this name to study the phenomenon of gender crossover in names, specifically how Leslie transitioned from being a common male name to one predominantly associated with females. The plot clearly shows that, historically, the name was initially given to both boys and girls, but the female counts began to sharply rise in the 1940s, peaking around 1960. In contrast, the male count for Leslie started a steep and consistent decline around the same period and has essentially flatlined since the 1980s. This pattern shows a clear shift in cultural association, demonstrating how the gender usage of a name is dynamic and can change dramatically within a few generations.

# Plotting a Mathematical Function (The Box Problem)

This section addresses the Box Problem for a piece of paper that is 36 inches by 48 inches and determines the cutout side length ($x$) that maximizes the box's volume.

#\| label: fig-box-problem
#\| fig-cap: "Figure 3: Volume of the box as a function of the cutout side length (x) for a 36\\" x 48\\" sheet of paper."

## Narrative Text

The plot in Figure 3 illustrates the volume of the box, $V(x)$, as a function of the side length of the cutout square, $x$. The function is defined over the practical domain of $x$, from 0 to 18 inches. The volume increases to a distinct peak before declining, consistent with the fact that both a zero cut ($x=0$) and a maximum cut ($x=18$) yield a box with zero volume. Using calculus to find the maximum point of this function, we determined that the maximum volume is achieved when the cutout side length is approximately $6.57$ inches. Cutting a square of this size results in a maximum possible volume of $\mathbf{5465.18}$ cubic inches for the resulting open-top box. The visualization is an excellent confirmation of this calculation, as the peak of the curve visually aligns with this optimal $x$ value.

## Reflections

The course has profoundly enhanced my understanding of the complete data analysis pipeline, moving from raw data to a fully reproducible narrative report. My most significant area of growth is in data wrangling and manipulation using the `tidyverse`. For instance, in the Armed Forces Data Wrangling project, I learned to not only clean data using functions like `filter()` and `mutate()`, but also to successfully use `pivot_longer()` to transform messy wide data into a tidy, case-by-case format, which is essential for analysis. This foundation directly translated into my ability to create effective data visualizations. I've learned that visualization is about more than just plotting; it requires adhering to principles of clarity and accessibility. For the Baby Names Time Series plot, I learned to incorporate colorblind-friendly design and to ensure the inclusion of necessary accessibility features, such as the `alt` argument in Quarto, turning a basic graph into a truly professional graphic. Finally, mastering the use of Quarto has been crucial, as I now understand how to integrate my code, results, and a coherent narrative text into a single, reproducible document, ensuring that my analysis is fully transparent and shareable.
