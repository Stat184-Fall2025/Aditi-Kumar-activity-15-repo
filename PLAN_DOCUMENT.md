# Project & Repository Plan Document

## 1. Project Plan
### Goal(s)
- Demonstrate understanding of GitHub version control skills (branches, commits, issues, pull requests).
- Build a clean and organized repository that meets all rubric requirements.
- Create meaningful commits, properly use the Issues system, and maintain clear documentation.

### Needs
- A main branch and a development branch.
- Multiple meaningful commits with clear messages.
- Issues created, tagged in commits, and closed properly.
- A readable README and this separate plan document.
- A clear workflow for development → review → merge.

### Steps
1. Create a `dev` branch from `main`.
2. Build the project structure by adding initial files.
3. Create multiple issues describing tasks.
4. Make commits on `dev` that reference or close issues.
5. Write clear commit messages following the “If applied, this commit will…” style.
6. Open pull requests from `dev` → `main` with descriptive titles and comments.
7. Merge changes into `main` when complete.
8. Keep documentation updated (README + Plan Document).
